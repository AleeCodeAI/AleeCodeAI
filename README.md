# **Hey there!**  
I’m **Alee**, but you might know me as **AleeCodeAI**.  

I’m an **AI Enthusiast** who loves building things powered by **code and curiosity**.  
If an idea hits me, I’ll probably turn it into a project (even if it keeps me up all night 😁).

### What I’m Learning?  
I’m currently exploring **different ways of getting the best out of LLMs, prompt and context engineering, LLM evaluations and I am also building cool automations with n8n**  

### What I’m Working With:  
🟦 **Python**  
🟫 **Large Language Models and Transformers**  
⬜️ **Hugging Face Pipelines**  
🟩 **LangChain**  
🟪 **Agent Development with LangChain and with Pure Code**   
🟦 **n8n workflows and its integrations with custom code (Hybrid Development)**  
🟨 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) & Evaluations**   
🟧 **APIs**    

Other tools and skills I use:  
🟪 **Streamlit**  
⬜ **Pandas**  
⬛ **Data Preparation** (Data Cleaning, Manipulation and Feature Engineering)

### Featured Project  
👉 [**Intelligent_Inbox_Manager**](https://github.com/AleeCodeAI/Intelligent_Inbox_Manager) — an email automation system that handles emails overload and intelligently manages them saving hours of time. It has a Backend that runs separately, a Frontend for important emails to be written manaually, getting human approval for certain emails and showing the entire system's analytics. It also has a FastAPI server that securely handles connection between the database logic and frontend

- I’d rather debug than sleep (sometimes).  
- My dream? To build my own AI agency one day.
