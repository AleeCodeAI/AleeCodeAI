# **Hey there!**  
I’m **Alee**, but you might know me as **AleeCodeAI**.  

I’m an **AI enthusiast** who loves building things powered by **code and curiosity**.  
If an idea hits me, I’ll probably turn it into a project (even if it keeps me up all night).

### 💡 What I’m Learning  
I’m currently exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — understanding how they **think**, **talk**, and **create**.  

### ⚙️ What I’m Working With  
My main stack includes **Python**, **LangChain**, **APIs**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.  

### 🚀 Featured Project  
👉 [**AI Project 1**](https://github.com/AleeCodeAI/AI-Project-1) — an app built with **three AI agents**, combining **RAG**, **APIs**, and **LangChain** to solve tasks collaboratively.

### 🎯 Fun Facts  
- I love making machines talk.  
- I’d rather debug than sleep (sometimes).  
- My dream? To build my own AI agency one day.

🧩 *Stay tuned — the experiments are just getting started.*
