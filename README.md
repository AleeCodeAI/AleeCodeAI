# Hey there!

I'm **Alee**, but you might know me as **AleeCodeAI**.

I'm an **AI Enthusiast** who loves building things powered by code and curiosity. If an idea hits me, I'll probably turn it into a project (even if it keeps me up all night 😁).

## What I'm Learning

Currently exploring **LLM optimization techniques**, **prompt & context engineering**, **LLM evaluations**, and building **cool automations with n8n**.
