# **Hey there!**  
I’m **Alee**, but you might know me as **AleeCodeAI**.  

I’m an **AI Enthusiast** who loves building things powered by **code and curiosity**.  
If an idea hits me, I’ll probably turn it into a project (even if it keeps me up all night 😁).

### What I’m Learning?  
I’m currently exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — understanding how they **think**, **talk**, and **create**.  

### What I’m Working With:  
🟦 **Python**  
🟫 **Large Language Models and Transformers**
⬜️ **Hugging Face Pipelines**
🟩 **LangChain**  
🟪 **Agent Development**  
🟨 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
🟧 **APIs**    

Other tools and skills I use:  
🟪 **Streamlit**  
⬜ **Pandas**  
⬛ **Data Preparation** (Data Cleaning, Manipulation and Feature Engineering)

### Featured Project  
👉 [**Multi-Agent-Intelligence**](https://github.com/AleeCodeAI/AI-Project-1) — an app built with **three AI agents**, combining **RAG**, **APIs**, and **LangChain** to solve tasks.

### Fun Facts  
- I love making machines talk.  
- I’d rather debug than sleep (sometimes).  
- My dream? To build my own AI agency one day.

*Stay tuned — the experiments are just getting started.*
